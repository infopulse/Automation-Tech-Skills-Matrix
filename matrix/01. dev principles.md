# Development Principles
Design Patterns, Software development principles, e.g., SOLID, DRY, KISS, etc.

## Trainee
- Has theoretical knowledge of what the OOP paradigm is; able to name at least one development principle (SOLID, DRY, KISS, etc.)
- Knows what a pattern is, the types of patterns, and the benefits of using them
- Knows DEV language basics: knows basic types
- Has basic knowledge of data types for a given programming language (PL) (primitive types)

## Junior
- Has practical experience and can provide examples of development principles (DRY/DIE, KISS, YAGNI)
- Knows at least one design pattern and is able to describe it
- Knows basic types and the difference between value and reference types
- Can read, understand, and analyze existing code and automated tests
- Can develop a simple automated test
- Knows 3+ different assertions and is able to use them
- Knows about complex data types and the differences between them for a given PL
- Able to perform data sorting and grouping

## Middle
- Can apply design patterns to the provided case
- Able to describe OOP principles applicable to a given PL (if applicable to the project)
- Can name and briefly describe each component of SOLID
- Understands different types of frameworks (Data-Driven, Keyword-Driven, Behavior-Driven, Object-Based)
- Can describe the test automation project structure and explain the purpose of each layer; understands how to set up the project from scratch
- Can read, understand, and refactor an existing automated test
- Able to describe 4+ complex data structures for a given language and compare complex data structures in terms of efficiency for a given task (e.g., Map vs. HashMap, or ArrayList vs. LinkedList)
- Can perform data operations like sorting, filtering, mapping, and serialization/deserialization

## Senior
- Can demonstrate or invent an example of a situation from experience when one or more of the SOLID principles were used
- Able to calculate automation ROI
- Has practical experience in building a test automation project from scratch
- Can analyze an existing Test Framework and identify bottlenecks
- Experienced in coding practices; uses efficient language features, language standards, and patterns
- Has experience on 2+ projects in developing and maintaining test frameworks; knows aspects of a given toolkit, such as libraries, modules, and passing and accepting variables to/from a CI system

## Expert
- Uses advanced development strategies and principles
- Understands the tradeoffs of various architecture solutions; can identify risks in the architecture of an existing test automation project and provide a plan to mitigate them
- Able to explain/sell the benefits of the selected architecture to stakeholders
- Takes responsibility for code stability, performance, and build/test execution time; improves metrics using recent PL features and IDE functionality
